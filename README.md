# Array Access Comparison 🚀

## Overview 📝
The **Array Access Comparison** project is designed to compare the performance and reliability of two different approaches to accessing elements in two-dimensional arrays. The first approach uses **subscripting** (array indexing), while the second uses **pointers** and **pointer arithmetic**. Both programs perform the same operations on arrays, but the underlying mechanisms differ. This comparison helps us analyze how each method impacts time efficiency and reliability.

### Key Points:
- **Program 1:** Uses subscripting to reference elements of a 2D array.
- **Program 2:** Uses pointers and pointer arithmetic to reference elements of a 2D array.
- **Objective:** Compare the time efficiency and reliability of both methods.

## Features ✨
- Comparison of array access methods: subscripting vs. pointer arithmetic 📊
- Performance benchmarking of both approaches using the `clock()` function ⏱️
- Error handling for memory allocation failures 🚨
- Clear documentation of findings for time efficiency and reliability analysis 📋
  
## Code Explanation 🖋️
The project consists of two C programs:

1. **Program 1:** Performs array accesses using subscripting (e.g., `arr[i][j]`).
2. **Program 2:** Performs the same array accesses using pointers and pointer arithmetic (e.g., `*(arr + i * size + j)`).
